## Hello there!
I am new to the world of GitHub but I have heard good things.
I have a background in science, with a focus on genetics. The rise of AI models has inspired me to seek out further education in this field, which led to an interest in Data Science.
I am proficient in Python, COBOL, and various forms of SQL. I am also currently learning JavaScript.
One day I hope to become a Data Architect.
